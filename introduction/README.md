# Introduction

## What is Machine Learning ?

Is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed [A.L.Samuel](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5392560/)

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: **"A computer program is said to
learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance
measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with 
experience E."** [M. Tom](http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~gabis/ml/ml-books/McGrawHill%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20-Tom%20Mitchell.pdf)

For instance, whay if we try to discover the E, T and P of a Robot driving 
learning problem:

* *Task T:* Driving on public four-lane highways using vision sensors
* *Performance Measure P:* Average distance traveled before an error (as 
judgeed for human overseer)
* *Training Experience E:* A sequence of images and steering commands recorded
while observing a human driver.
